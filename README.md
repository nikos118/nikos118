## About

Toward the end of my third year of university, I founded **SalesBop** — an AI sales coaching platform — and committed fully to building it. Over the next ~2 years, I took it from concept → shipped product → GTM execution → acquisition.

After graduating, I led every facet of the company: architecture and technical implementation, product iteration loops, outbound/customer acquisition systems, and day-to-day operations.

On **Feb 26, 2025**, we officially closed the acquisition by **FliteHouse**. Today, I lead the technology team there, continuing to scale what we started — now with a larger team and a broader mission to unify people, process, and technology into one cohesive revenue ecosystem.

Currently my favorite paper is [this one](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.09882v1).
