## 🧠 About
Toward the end of my third year of university, I founded **SalesBop**—an AI sales coaching platform—and committed fully to building it. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} Over the next ~2 years, I took it from concept → shipped product → GTM execution → acquisition.

After graduating, I led every faucet of the company: architecture and technical implementation, product iteration loops, outbound/customer acquisition systems, and day-to-day operations.

On **Feb 26, 2025**, we officially closed the acquisition by **FliteHouse**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} Today, I lead the technology team there, continuing to scale what we started—now with a larger team and a broader mission to unify people, process, and technology into one cohesive revenue ecosystem.
